      <strong>MangoTrade IO WALLET</strong>
      <p>
        MangoTrade IO Wallet is&nbsp;a&nbsp;virtual currency wallet that enables
        User to&nbsp;receive, store, send, and exchange virtual currencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        User can store different virtual currencies in&nbsp;MangoTrade IO Wallet.

        virtual currency from the list of&nbsp;virtual currencies supported
        by&nbsp;MangoTrade IO Wallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        User accepts and understands that MangoTrade IO Wallet is&nbsp;not
        a&nbsp;bank account and virtual currencies stored in&nbsp;User’s
        MangoTrade IO Wallet will not earn any interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        MangoTrade IO Wallet will permit User to&nbsp;generate one or&nbsp;more
        addresses to&nbsp;which virtual currencies may be&nbsp;transferred from
        a&nbsp;wallet, exchange or&nbsp;address not hosted or&nbsp;controlled

        accepted and approved by&nbsp;EOTRADEX&nbsp;OÜ. User must have
        sufficient funds to&nbsp;cover any applicable withdrawal fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Virtual currencies held in&nbsp;User’s MangoTrade IO Wallet belong
        to&nbsp;a&nbsp;physical or&nbsp;legal person who has been verified
        as&nbsp;a&nbsp;registered owner of&nbsp;MangoTrade IO Wallet.
      </p>
      <p>MangoTrade IO Wallet does not perform and support margin trading.</p>
      <p>
        Settlement process is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;public blockchains operated
        by&nbsp;a&nbsp;decentralized network of&nbsp;independent third parties.
        Therefore, User acknowledges, agrees and accepts that a&nbsp;transaction
        on&nbsp;MangoTrade IO may not be&nbsp;completed, or&nbsp;may
        be&nbsp;substantially delayed by&nbsp;the network.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Deposits</strong></p>
      <p>
        User may from time to&nbsp;time transfer to&nbsp;MangoTrade IO Wallet any
        virtual currency that is&nbsp;supported for transfer and storage using
        <a href="https://mangotrade.io/">https://mangotrade.io/</a>, MangoTrade IO Wallet
